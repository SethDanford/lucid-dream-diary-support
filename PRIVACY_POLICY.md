Privacy Policy for Lucid Dream Diary

Effective date: 30/12/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how I Seth Danford ("we", "us", "our") handles information in the Lucid Dream Diary mobile application (the "App").

Summary
- The App stores your entries on your device.
- Optional iCloud backup can sync entries and preferences to your iCloud account.
- We do not run our own servers for this App and do not sell your data.

Information we handle

1) Information you enter in the App
The App allows you to create dream entries and related details (for example: dates, tags, notes, ratings, technique details, and optional voice memos). This information is stored locally on your device. Voice memos are saved in the App's local storage.

2) Microphone access
If you choose to record voice memos, the App asks for microphone permission. Audio is recorded and stored locally on your device. We do not receive or transmit your recordings.

3) Optional iCloud backup (iOS)
If you enable iCloud backup, the App stores your entries and preferences in your iCloud account using Apple's iCloud key-value storage. This data is handled by Apple under their privacy policy. Audio files are not uploaded by the App.

4) Exports and imports
If you export data (CSV or PDF) or import a CSV, the file is processed locally on your device and shared only when you choose to share it.

5) In-app purchases
If you buy the optional customization unlock, the transaction is processed by Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not receive your payment information. The store may provide us with a purchase status to unlock features.

What we do not collect
- No account is required.
- We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, or browsing activity.
- We do not use analytics or advertising SDKs in the App.

How we use information
We use the information you provide only to:
- Save and display your entries and preferences.
- Record and play back voice memos.
- Sync data to iCloud if you enable it.
- Export or import your entries at your request.
- Unlock features after an in-app purchase.

Sharing of information
We do not sell or rent your information. We share information only as follows:
- With Apple iCloud, if you enable iCloud backup.
- With Apple App Store or Google Play for in-app purchase processing.
- With other apps or services you choose when you export or share a file.

Data storage and retention
- Local data remains on your device until you remove it (for example by deleting the App or clearing its storage).
- If iCloud backup is enabled, Apple retains the iCloud copy until you delete it or manage it in iOS iCloud settings.

Your choices
- You can use the App without enabling microphone access or iCloud backup.
- You control exports and imports.
- You can remove local data by deleting the App or clearing its storage; manage iCloud data in iOS Settings.

Security
We rely on your device's security features and Apple/Google protections. No method of storage is 100% secure.

Children's privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date will be updated when changes are posted.
