Common questions

1) Where is my data stored?
Your entries are stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud backup on iOS, your entries and preferences sync to your iCloud account.

2) Are voice memos included in exports or iCloud?
Voice memos are stored locally. They are not included in CSV/PDF exports. If you enable iCloud backup, only entries and preferences sync (not audio files).

3) How do I export my entries?
Open Settings and use Export PDF or Export CSV. Export uses the native share sheet.

4) How do I import from CSV?
Open Settings and use Import CSV. Only CSVs exported from this app are supported.

5) How do I enable iCloud backup?
On iOS, open Settings and toggle iCloud Backup. You must be signed in to iCloud and have iCloud Drive on, on the device.

6) How do I restore a purchase?
Open Settings and tap Restore in the Customizable look section.
